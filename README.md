# ThymeWriter

Thymewriter is, essentially, a combination of scrivener and those websites that let you track words per day. 

It will have two major features: the words-per-day tracker, and an interconnected worldbuilding notes tracker. As well as this, it will give you silly little achievements for meeting word-per-day goals etc., and have a basic built-in word processor that automatically adds anything typed in it to your words per day.
